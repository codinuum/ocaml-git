    values and the SHA1 of the corresponding inflated objects. *)

(** The usual [Object.S.input] function, but with an additional
    [index] argument. When [index] is [None], recompute the whole
    index: that's very costly so provide the index when possible. *)

(** Return the value stored in the pack file. *)

(** Return the value stored in the pack file. *)

(** Unpack a whole pack file. [write] should returns the SHA1 of the
    marshaled value. Return the IDs of the written objects. *)

      position-dependant deltas. *)
